## Compiling

Make sure you have gcc/g++ installed, as well as make.
Run make to compile all scripts. You can then find the compiled executables in the bin folder.

### Compiling All Scripts at Once

```bash
make
./bin/day1  # Replace 1 with the respective day (1...25)
```

### Compiling a Single Script

```bash
make day1  # Replace 1 with the respective day (1...25)
./bin/day1  # Replace 1 with the respective day (1...25)
```
